# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, and it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

Docs are local at `node_modules/vite-plus/docs` or online at https://viteplus.dev/guide/.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to format, lint, type check and test changes.
- [ ] Check if there are `vite.config.ts` tasks or `package.json` scripts necessary for validation, run via `vp run <script>`.

## Void

This project uses [Void](https://void.cloud) — a fullstack Vite plugin + deployment platform for Cloudflare. `voidPlugin()` in `vite.config.ts` gives you file-based API routing on Hono (`routes/`), Inertia-inspired server-rendered pages with co-located loaders/actions (`pages/` + `@void/vue` or `@void/react`), auto-provisioned D1/KV/R2 bindings, first-class Drizzle ORM integration (schema in `db/schema.ts` -> `void/db` Drizzle instance -> typed routes -> typed fetch client), built-in auth, queues, cron jobs, edge caching (ISR), and one-command deploys via `npx void deploy`. For first-time setup, prefer `npx void init`; the interactive flow can scaffold the app, configure project files, handle auth, and link or create the deploy project before the first deploy. Void is published on the public npm registry — install it directly as `void` with no aliases, registry overrides, or auth tokens.

Database: define Drizzle tables in `db/schema.ts`, import `db` from `void/db` and tables from `@schema`. Use `void db push` for prototyping, `void db generate` for production migrations. `drizzle-orm` and `drizzle-kit` ship with void (no extra install). Migrations live in `db/migrations/`.

Full docs are in `node_modules/void/docs/`. If you have the `void` skill available, use it for a complete API reference covering project structure, routing, pages mode, database, auth, typed fetch, KV, storage, queues, cron jobs, CLI, configuration, and deployment.
